### Connect 4 with MiniMax algorithm with Alpha Beta Pruning

* created a connect 4 project which has 4 options, human, greedy, random and alpha beta
    * human: just the standard human player that can be controlled by clicking on the board
    * greedy: always plays on the left until it sees a win anywhere on the board, then it will play that move. Does not care about blocking or strategy
    * random: completely randomly chooses a valid move on the board
    * alphabeta: this uses the alpha beta algorithm using time and depth parameters
* has a changeable board size and restart game options
