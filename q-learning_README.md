* Made a q-learning project where a bot tries to get to a terminal state which maximizes rewards but minimizing punishment
* The default reward of doing any move is -1 and reaching a goal state is a reward of 0, upon reaching a terminal state, the bot is ported to a random location on the map
* The user can place tile, remove tile, change rewards of locations, and move the bot
* There is also a visual graph to see the average iterations taken at each run of the program
