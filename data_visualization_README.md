### Data Visualization project 

* Our client was the Transportation Safety Board of Canada. They are a governmental agency responsible for advancing the safety of airway, railway, and marine transportation in Canada.
* They provided was with data that spanned almost 30 years and tasked us to answer “Where should efforts be focused to improve the safety of Canadian air space?”
* After some serious data wrangling and many interations to make the message and story as accessible as possible to the general public, this is what we came up with.
