### Course registration website

* For my web development course I created a fully functional course registration website. 
* A few of the functions include, but are not limited to:
    1. registering new users
    2. login/logout functionality
    3. registering for courses using different methods (CRN or the traditional name, number and section)
    4. a dynamic search that updates as the user types
    5. a student schedule
    6. a printable and downloadable enrollment verification PDF generator
