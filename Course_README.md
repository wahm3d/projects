### Course registration website

* For my web development course I created a fully functional course registration website.
* I used JavaScript and NodeJS for the backend. 
* Express for request handling from the client side 
* And MongoDB for database purposes.
* I also wrote Mocha tests to make sure everything was working as intended.  
* A few of the functions include, but are not limited to:
    * registering new users
    * login/logout functionality
    * registering for courses using different methods (CRN or the traditional name, number and section)
    * a dynamic search that updates as the user types
    * a student schedule
    * a printable and downloadable enrollment verification PDF generator
    * updating user info and picture.
